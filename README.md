kb_builder
==========

The `kb_builder` is the original engine that ran the [builder.swillkb.com](http://builder.swillkb.com) service.  That service has since been completely rewritten from scratch in Golang, but this project is still a useful environment to hack on.  

This tool uses the JSON layout generated by the [Keyboard Layout Editor](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/).  It has a lot of additional features for modifying the output of the plate.  Check the `?` next to the Plate Layout text field in the UI for more details.

This tool is implemented as a webserver and exposes a UI to be consumed in the browser, but it is not fit for actual web traffic because it can not handle the drawing of more than one layout at a time.  This however should not be a limitiation for personal use.
